Board shuffling
    To shuffle bombs on board I have used
    Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm.


Position neighbors
    I have created transformation table for
    position in one dimension to two dimensions (row and column).


Right click
    Is done via listening on 'contextmenu' event. Immediately after
    click is called 'preventDefault' function.



Mine sweeper end condition
    1) There was a clic on a bomb
    2) All bombs are flagged and the rest checked
